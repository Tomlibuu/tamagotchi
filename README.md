## Tamagotchi

This project is our schoolproject where we in group of three developed tamagotchi. The programmable device was SensorTag. We used embedded C for programming.

Main functionalities which we implented were UART connection between ready-made backend and our device, read data from sensors and use that to recognize different action (in this project we needed to either pet, feed or exercise the tamagotchi by actions), 
interruption handling for buttons for different use cases and notify user with buzzer sounds when the tamagotchi needs something or some action have been recognized. We also helped users to recognize which action they are going to proceed with leds. 
Only main file is attached here and it is not testable individually. There were ready-made libraries for different functions and main operations for Sensortag in whole project but our main work has been done in main.c file so it has been only attached.

The project was made in collaboration with Alex Heikkinen and Hannu Sirvi√∂.
